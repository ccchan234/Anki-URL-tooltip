I apologize for the confusion, and I understand that manually adding the `title` attribute to every link would be impractical if you have many links. Unfortunately, Anki's default behavior doesn't include displaying hyperlinks as tooltips, and there's no built-in setting to enable this feature for all links at once.

However, you might be able to achieve this behavior using custom JavaScript within your card template. Here's an example of how you could do this:

1. Open Anki and go to the card template editor as described in my previous message.
2. In the "Back Template" or "Front Template" section (depending on where you want the links to appear), add the following JavaScript code at the end:

```html
<script>
  document.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(function(link) {
    link.title = link.href;
  });
</script>
```

This code uses JavaScript to find all hyperlinks (`<a>` elements) within the card and sets the `title` attribute of each link to its `href` attribute (i.e., the URL). This should cause the URL to be displayed as a tooltip when you hover over any link within the card.

Please note that this code will affect all links within the specified card type, so you may want to test it thoroughly to make sure it behaves as expected. Also, be aware that Anki's support for JavaScript might vary between platforms and versions, so this code might not work in all cases.

Again, I apologize for the inconvenience, and I understand that this might not be an ideal solution. If this feature is important to you, you might consider requesting it as a feature or looking for an add-on that provides this functionality. The Anki community is quite active, and developers often create add-ons to meet specific user needs.
